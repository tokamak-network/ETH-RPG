## 1. Product Hunt

**Title**: Eth·RPG — Turn your Ethereum wallet into an RPG hero

**Tagline**: Paste any ETH address, get your hero card in 10 seconds

**Description**:
```
Eth·RPG analyzes your on-chain Ethereum activity and generates a unique RPG character card.

What you get:
- Class assignment from 8 archetypes (Hunter, Rogue, Wizard, Guardian...)
- 7 stats calculated from real transaction data (Level, HP, MP, STR, INT, DEX, LUCK)
- AI-generated hero lore based on your wallet's history
- Combat Power score for bragging rights
- Beautiful dark fantasy card you can download and share

No wallet connect. No signing. Completely read-only and safe.

Built with Next.js, Alchemy SDK, Claude AI, and @vercel/og.
```

**Categories**: Web3, Gaming, AI

**Maker Comment**:
```
Hey everyone! I built Eth·RPG because I wanted to answer a fun question: if your Ethereum wallet were an RPG character, what would it be?

The app analyzes real on-chain data — your transaction history, DeFi swaps, NFT trades, bridge usage, gas spent — and maps it to RPG stats and one of 8 character classes.

The AI lore is my favorite part. It weaves actual crypto events (the Merge, NFT Summer, DeFi Summer) into your character's backstory. Every wallet gets a unique story.

Tech stack: Next.js 16, Alchemy SDK for on-chain data, Claude API for lore generation, @vercel/og for server-rendered card images. Everything runs server-side — no wallet connection needed.

Would love to hear what class you get!

**Screenshots needed** (5):

2. Loading screen (pixel art animation)
3. Character card front (stats + class)
4. Character card back (lore + achievements)
5. Share flow (buttons + OG preview)

## 5. Reddit r/ethereum

**Title**: I built a tool that turns your ETH wallet into an RPG character — no wallet connect needed

**Body**:
```
Hey r/ethereum!

I built Eth·RPG, a free tool that analyzes your Ethereum wallet's on-chain history and generates a unique RPG character card.

**How it works:**
- Paste any ETH address or ENS name
- It reads your transaction history (completely read-only, no wallet connect, no signing)
- Assigns you one of 8 RPG classes based on your activity patterns
- Calculates 7 stats from real data (Level, HP, MP, STR, INT, DEX, LUCK)
- Generates AI lore that references actual crypto events
- Gives you a Combat Power score

**The 8 classes:**
- Hunter — NFT collectors
- Rogue — DEX power users
- Summoner — Bridge enthusiasts
- Merchant — Stablecoin operators
- Priest — Gas-heavy contract deployers
- Elder Wizard — OG wallets (4+ years, low activity)
- Guardian — Diamond hands (high balance, low tx)
- Warrior — Default adventurer

**Tech:** Next.js, Alchemy SDK for on-chain data, Claude AI for lore, @vercel/og for card rendering. Everything server-side.

Try it: https://eth-rpg-omega.vercel.app?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=community

Would love feedback. What class did you get?

## 6. Hacker News — Show HN

**Title**: Show HN: Eth·RPG – Turn an Ethereum wallet into an RPG character card

**Body**:
```
https://eth-rpg-omega.vercel.app?utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=community

Eth·RPG takes any Ethereum address and generates an RPG character card from on-chain data.

It classifies transactions (NFT trades, DEX swaps, bridge transfers, contract interactions) to determine one of 8 character classes, then calculates stats using log-scale formulas on real metrics like transaction count, gas spent, unique contracts interacted with, and wallet age.

The AI lore component uses Claude to generate a fantasy backstory that references actual crypto timeline events (The Merge, DeFi Summer, etc.) matched to the wallet's activity period.

Card images are rendered server-side with @vercel/og (Satori). No wallet connection or signing required — it's completely read-only using Alchemy SDK.

Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Alchemy SDK, Claude API, @vercel/og, Vercel KV, Tailwind CSS.
```
